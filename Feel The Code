Rust Learning Log â€“ Day 2 (August 9, 2025)
Summary
I continued hands-on practice with Rust syntax drills, deliberately debugging broken code samples to sharpen both logic and attention to detail.

Challenges & Solutions

    Challenge: Remembering the correct Rust syntax when switching between multiple drills.
    Solution: Drilled, drilled, and drilled for hours until it felt like second nature. 
    Challenge: My head hurt, I was stressed, I felt like it was impossible.
    Solution: Research, drill. Research, drill, Research again, and drill again. Using chat gpt to come up with complicated
problems based on the first 3 chapters I'm on in the "Rust Bible," and solved them. I will keep drilling these issues until its
as easy for me to solve these problems as it is to drive a car. 

Takeaway:
Coding is just like creating a chain of events. The more I practice, the more I really feel the code. A river that I feed informations too.
I truly believe I'm starting to feel the code. It still feels very foreign, but I believe it will all come together soon/
