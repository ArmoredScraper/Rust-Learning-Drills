# Rust-Learning-Drills
Using ChatGPT to create coding drills with broken code so I can get better and faster at recognizing issues. I want to build a solid foundation and know Rust like the back of my hand.
# Rust Scalar Types Mastery — Day Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Topic:** Rust Scalar Types (Ch.1–Ch.3 Integration)

---

## 📌 Overview
This session focused on **deep mastery** of Rust’s scalar types — especially integers — while integrating concepts from Chapter 1 through Chapter 3 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

Instead of skimming once, the approach was **deliberate overtraining**:
- Boss-scenario drills
- Broken code repairs
- “Hello, World” mini-programs
- Compiler-error exploration
- **Keyboard efficiency practice** — avoiding reliance on editor automation and the Tab key in RustRover to build muscle memory for writing code faster without assistive shortcuts.

The goal: **automatic recall** of syntax, type rules, and keyboard sequences.

## 🛠 What We Covered

### Scalar Types
- **Integers**: signed & unsigned (`i8` → `i128`, `u8` → `u128`, `isize`, `usize`)
- **Floats**: `f32` & `f64` (precision, defaults)
- **Booleans**: `bool` (conditions, control flow)
- **Characters**: `char` (Unicode range, examples)

### Reinforced Fundamentals
- Variables, mutability, constants, shadowing
- Printing with `println!` (named & positional args)
- Unary vs binary operators
- Type inference vs explicit annotation
- Overflow handling (`wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `saturating_*`)
- Casting between integer types
- Array indexing rules (`usize`)
- Triggering & understanding compiler errors
- **Keyboard discipline** — writing full syntax manually to build lasting speed and precision

## 🎯 Learning Style
This is a **rare, high-retention method**:
1. **Boss-Scenario Drills** — Realistic “fix and explain” tasks.
2. **Active Recall** — Applying concepts immediately.
3. **Error-First Learning** — Causing and decoding compiler errors.
4. **Constant Integration** — Mixing new types with previous syntax.
5. **High Repetition** — Multiple `Hello, World` builds for syntax muscle memory.
6. **No-Tab Policy** — Improving typing efficiency and accuracy through deliberate manual formatting and navigation.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
> **AI cannot replace human programming skill.**  
> Programming = *judgment*, *adaptability*, *problem-solving*.  
> AI is a **tool** — here it acts as an always-ready training partner,  
> but the human makes the design choices and writes the final code.
